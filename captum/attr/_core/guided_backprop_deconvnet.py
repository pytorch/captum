                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.

                        to the number of examples (aka batch size), and if

                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the

                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
