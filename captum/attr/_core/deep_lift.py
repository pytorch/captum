class DeepLift(GradientAttribution):
    r"""
    Implements DeepLIFT algorithm based on the following paper:
    Learning Important Features Through Propagating Activation Differences,
    Avanti Shrikumar, et. al.
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685

    and the gradient formulation proposed in:
    Towards better understanding of gradient-based attribution methods for
    deep neural networks,  Marco Ancona, et.al.
    https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy21R9JAW

    This implementation supports only Rescale rule. RevealCancel rule will
    be supported in later releases.
    In addition to that, in order to keep the implementation cleaner, DeepLIFT
    for internal neurons and layers extends current implementation and is
    implemented separately in LayerDeepLift and NeuronDeepLift.
    Although DeepLIFT's(Rescale Rule) attribution quality is comparable with
    Integrated Gradients, it runs significantly faster than Integrated
    Gradients and is preferred for large datasets.

    Currently we only support a limited number of non-linear activations
    but the plan is to expand the list in the future.

    Note: As we know, currently we cannot access the building blocks,
    of PyTorch's built-in LSTM, RNNs and GRUs such as Tanh and Sigmoid.
    Nonetheless, it is possible to build custom LSTMs, RNNS and GRUs
    with performance similar to built-in ones using TorchScript.
    More details on how to build custom RNNs can be found here:

                        In the literature this is also known as local vs global
                        attribution. If inputs' multiplier isn't factored in

                        attribution. If it is, then that type of attribution
                        method is called global.

                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples (aka batch size), and if
                        multiple input tensors are provided, the examples must
                        be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (scalar, Tensor, tuple of scalar, or Tensor, optional):
                        Baselines define reference samples that are compared with
                        the inputs. In order to assign attribution scores DeepLift
                        computes the differences between the inputs/outputs and
                        corresponding references.
                        Baselines can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                          dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                          with inputs.

                        - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                          be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                        - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                          to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                          - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                            corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                            or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                            dimensions match with the corresponding
                            input tensor.

                          - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                            inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                            for corresponding input tensor.

                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, Tensor, or list, optional): Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (Any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                        or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                        forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                        convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                        is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                        a tuple following attributions.
                        Default: False
            custom_attribution_func (Callable, optional): A custom function for
                        computing final attribution scores. This function can take
                        at least one and at most three arguments with the
                        following signature:

                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers)
                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs)
                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs, baselines)

                        In case this function is not provided, we use the default
                        logic defined as: multipliers * (inputs - baselines)
                        It is assumed that all input arguments, `multipliers`,
                        `inputs` and `baselines` are provided in tuples of same
                        length. `custom_attribution_func` returns a tuple of
                        attribution tensors that have the same length as the
                        `inputs`.

                        Default: None

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]*):
                Attribution score computed based on DeepLift rescale rule with respect
                to each input feature. Attributions will always be
                the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                corresponding sized tensors is returned.
            - **delta** (*Tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                This is computed using the property that
                the total sum of forward_func(inputs) - forward_func(baselines)
                must equal the total sum of the attributions computed
                based on DeepLift's rescale rule.
                Delta is calculated per example, meaning that the number of
                elements in returned delta tensor is equal to the number of
                examples in input.
                Note that the logic described for deltas is guaranteed when the
                default logic for attribution computations is used, meaning that the
                `custom_attribution_func=None`, otherwise it is not guaranteed and
                depends on the specifics of the `custom_attribution_func`.

            inputs (Tensor or tuple[Tensor, ...]): Input for which
                        attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples (aka batch size), and if
                        multiple input tensors are provided, the examples must
                        be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (Tensor, tuple[Tensor, ...], or Callable):
                        Baselines define reference samples that are compared with
                        the inputs. In order to assign attribution scores DeepLift
                        computes the differences between the inputs/outputs and
                        corresponding references. Baselines can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          the first dimension equal to the number of examples
                          in the baselines' distribution. The remaining dimensions
                          must match with input tensor's dimension starting from
                          the second dimension.

                        - a tuple of tensors, if inputs is a tuple of tensors,
                          with the first dimension of any tensor inside the tuple
                          equal to the number of examples in the baseline's
                          distribution. The remaining dimensions must match
                          the dimensions of the corresponding input tensor
                          starting from the second dimension.

                        - callable function, optionally takes `inputs` as an
                          argument and either returns a single tensor
                          or a tuple of those.

                        It is recommended that the number of samples in the baselines'
                        tensors is larger than one.
            target (int, tuple, Tensor, or list, optional): Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (Any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                        or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                        forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                        convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                        is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                        a tuple following attributions.
                        Default: False
            custom_attribution_func (Callable, optional): A custom function for
                        computing final attribution scores. This function can take
                        at least one and at most three arguments with the
                        following signature:

                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers)
                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs)
                        - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs, baselines)

                        In case this function is not provided we use the default
                        logic defined as: multipliers * (inputs - baselines)
                        It is assumed that all input arguments, `multipliers`,
                        `inputs` and `baselines` are provided in tuples of same
                        length. `custom_attribution_func` returns a tuple of
                        attribution tensors that have the same length as the
                        `inputs`.
                        Default: None

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]*):
                        Attribution score computed based on DeepLift rescale rule with
                        respect to each input feature. Attributions will always be
                        the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned.
            - **delta** (*Tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                        This is computed using the property that the
                        total sum of forward_func(inputs) - forward_func(baselines)
                        must be very close to the total sum of attributions
                        computed based on approximated SHAP values using
                        Deeplift's rescale rule.
                        Delta is calculated for each example input and baseline pair,
                        meaning that the number of elements in returned delta tensor
                        is equal to the
                        `number of examples in input` * `number of examples
                        in baseline`. The deltas are ordered in the first place by
                        input example, followed by the baseline.
                        Note that the logic described for deltas is guaranteed
                        when the default logic for attribution computations is used,
                        meaning that the `custom_attribution_func=None`, otherwise
                        it is not guaranteed and depends on the specifics of the
                        `custom_attribution_func`.
