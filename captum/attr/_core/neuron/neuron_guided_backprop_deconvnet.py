    Computes attribution of the given neuron using deconvolution.
    Deconvolution computes the gradient of the target output with
    respect to the input, but gradients of ReLU functions are overridden so
    that the gradient of the ReLU input is simply computed taking ReLU of
    the output gradient, essentially only propagating non-negative gradients
    (without dependence on the sign of the ReLU input).

    in these papers:

                        Neuron selector can be provided as:

                        - a single integer, if the layer output is 2D. This integer
                          selects the appropriate neuron column in the layer input

                        Deconvolution attribution of
                        particular neuron with respect to each input feature.
